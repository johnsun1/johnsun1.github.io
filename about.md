My name is John Sun, and I am a Software Developer. This site is meant as a place for me to share my thoughts on current trends in technology, and science. I chose GitHub to host my site, because the lack
of advertisements means that, visitors are not distracted from the content during their visit. Anyways,
enjoy your stay. If you have any questions, I can be reached via email.
