It’s that time of the year again when Apple unveils it’s latest line of iPhones. I am always excited for the September keynote because it’s interesting, and exciting to see what Apple is changing with the iPhone. (It’s also cool because iOS usually gets a significant update with every new iPhone.)

I sleep and wake up early, like a little boy on Christmas Eve trying to get to and open his presents as fast as possible. Before and during the keynote, I follow live blogs, and streams of the event. Afterward, I watch countless YouTube videos, rewatch the keynote from within iTunes, and read blogs about the new iDevices announced earlier that day.

This year is going to be different for me. In contrast to late 2014, when I waited in line at the AT&T store for hours (image above) to pre-order the iPhone 6 Plus. I plan to buy a used, heavily discounted iPhone 7 Plus, following Apple’s special event in September. It has the performance and screen size that I require but at a fraction of the cost of a brand new 2018 iPhone.

iPhone prices have soared since the days of carrier subsidized devices. Nowadays, it can cost around $1,000 (per device, per year) for you to own the latest and greatest iPhone. Although it sounds absurd to spend more than $1,000 for a phone, we have to remember that the iPhone is more than that.

For many people, the iPhone is their computer for everything; from gaming, job searching and watching movies. Having said that, most people do not need all of the latest features that the iPhone 8, X, and it’s upcoming 2018 successors have to offer; I certainly do not need them.

When the new iPhone is announced, I believe that used iPhone 6 and 7 devices will become heavily discounted, as resellers scramble to get rid of their “obsolete” devices. I am currently using an iPhone SE (16GB), and will significantly benefit from the larger screen, and improved performance. Or, you know, I could just stick with my older device and save money, and the environment in the process.
