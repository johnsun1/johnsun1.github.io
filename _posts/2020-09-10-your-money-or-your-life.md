I have recently finished reading through Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin (YMOYL), and here are my thoughts. Going into this reading, I was already conscious about spending, saving, and investing, so in that way, this book did not radically change my viewpoint. However, I did learn a few things that I will share here.

###### Your Money or Your Life ######

### Having Enough ###
A big part of finding satisfaction in life is knowing when you have "enough". That is, how much money, how much income do you need to pay for your necessary expenses? More is not always better, and there's a point when pursuing a higher salary or hourly rate will decrease your satisfaction of life more than it benefits you. Knowing how much money is enough will allow us to free up resources (both mental and temporal) to pursue our interests, and hobbies. We become the architects of our own lives.

### Frugal, not Cheap ###
Many of us think of being frugal as pinching every penny, saving every dollar. It's as if spending money were objectively a bad thing. YMOYL talks about spending on things that bring value and meaning to your life and cutting out everything else. This reminds me of the difference between being frugal or being cheap. The former is about intelligently saving money; i.e., buying expensive shoes that you love, that will last a long time. The later is about buying cheap shoes that you dislike, that will not last as long. If YMOYL is to be taken seriously, we should all spend MORE money on the things that matter to us. Our job is to find out what is vital and invest accordingly.

### Sharing is Caring ###
YMOYL talks about building community and sharing material wealth to minimize the amount of capital required to reach financial independence. For instance: instead of buying a lawnmower, you could borrow your neighbor's, and in exchange, you could help them file their taxes, or walk the dog. In doing so you can meet your material, as well as spiritual and social needs. This is what is referred to as building your natural wealth.

I am someone who prides themselves on being frugal because I believe that, the more we save (and invest) the more free we become. While YMOYL did not revolutionalize my worldview, it has deepened my understanding of what it means to be frugal. Spending money is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as we spend on the correct things.
