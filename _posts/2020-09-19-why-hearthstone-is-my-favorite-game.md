I have played Hearthstone since the open beta. I remember when the beta ended and all of our card collections were reset. (We were given gold commensurate to the number of packs we had purchased during the beta.) Hearthstone is a collectible card game where you play against other players in a variety of game modes. I like Hearthstone because it's more casual than more serious card games, like Magic the Gathering, while still scratching that "strategic (or competitive) itch". While I do not claim to be a top tier player, I have collected several golden heroes (500 ranked wins per hero) with one honored hero (1000 ranked wins). I have also achieved the Legend rank. Here is my opinion on the game, and the reasons why I like it so much.

### Resourceful Play ###
Certain deck archetypes reward conserving resources and "greedy play". My favorite deck type has always been the control deck. You are rewarded with using your resources sparingly, and you win by playing large threats that your opponent cannot deal with. While these kinds of decks have largely fallen out of favor in the current meta (ME AGGRO ME GO FACE or LIBRAM PALADIN GOES BURRRR or TURTLE MAGE GOES BURRRR), it is one of the reasons I like Hearthstone.

### Gateway Game ###
Hearthstone is a great way to get into the Warcraft universe. And for people already familiar with the Warcraft franchise, like me, it's a great way to see your favorite characters in action. There are some fun interactions between certain characters (for instance, Illidan and Tyrande) that are a ton of fun, especially if you're familiar with the lore of Warcraft.

### Polish ###
Like Blizzard or not, they have delivered on a very polished game with Hearthstone. The sounds, the graphics all come together to immerse you in the world of Warcraft. (The card game, not the MMO haha!) Prominent characters, such as Jaina Proudmoore, Illidan Stormrage, Anduin Wynn, are introduced to people who might not have played the Warcraft RTS. Maybe these folks find the lore very interesting, and now they've discovered Warcraft. 

All this is to say Hearthstone is one of my favorite games, notwithstanding the ~$80 cost/expansion to be competitive, and the lack of deck diversity at higher levels of competition. The game has come a long way since Beta, and I look forward to what the Blizzard team has in store for us.
