###### A snapshot of my schedule ######

I have recently been following a set schedule, every day of every week, for about a month now. I've always had some inkling of a schedule, but I never followed anything so rigorous until now. I would follow one schedule during the week, and an entirely different one for the weekend. Now that I've been doing this for a month, I love it, and here's why.

### Life on EZ Mode ###
I love that I can go through my day without having to figure out what I should be doing at any given time. "Should I be reading? Meditating? Cleaning my car? All of the above!?" Now I know exactly what I should be doing, and I have made the time for the things that matter most, which leads to the next benefit.

### Making Time for Things ###
Having a schedule makes it easier for me to accomplish my goals. For instance, I had a vague intention to do meditation more often during the week, but I wasn't sure if I should do it in the morning, evening, or afternoon. I would even forget to do it sometimes. Enter the schedule. Now, I know that I always meditate in the morning after taking my shower. Then, I brew a cup of coffee and work on personal (or professional) development projects. This is also the time I use to check my email.

Having a set schedule has made me more productive, and it has lifted the burden of having to figure out how to allocate my days as I have already done that work ahead of time; by creating a schedule for myself. Although there is an element of spontaneity that is lost, I don't intend to strictly follow the schedule from now until the end of my life. I will obviously allow myself spontaneous days to do whatever I want. But, for most of the time, I'll stick to the plan.
