Recently, I have become more interested in personal finance and the idea of retiring early to pursue the activities that mean the most to me. Often this involves saving money and investing it. There are many strategies for growing wealth, but I found the approach that appealed to me the most is investing in index funds. They're inherently diversified, and often you can buy into them regularly and for no fees.

### What is an index fund? ###
Index funds are buckets of assets that track an index. When you purchase shares of an index fund, you are buying partial ownership of all of the assets in that container. The convenient thing about index funds is that most of them allow you to set up automatic investments so that you do not have to handle your finances at all, which can prevent you from panic buying or selling during market events. Even better, if you're trading with the brokerage that offers the particular index fund you are interested in, it is probably free to purchase those index fund shares. Index funds are a great value!

### Buy and hold ###
The "buy and hold" strategy is when you buy into an investment asset regularly to potentially lower your cost basis, and do not sell until you are ready to retire. You buy into dips, as well as growing periods, and overall you make a healthy profit. Putting your investment strategy on "auto-pilot" makes it unlikely that you will panic sell or panic buy. Most of the challenge of investing is psychological. 

I didn't learn about the importance of saving and investing from my parents. I had to find out about this myself. When I entered the workforce with jobs that were "dead ends," I found more and more that I did not want to spend my entire life in this way. I had many passions that I wanted to pursue but lacked the financial freedom to go after my dreams. 

I learned all I could about personal finance and investing in the long-term on YouTube. Long-term because I am not someone who understands the stock market, so I went with a simple approach to grow wealth. I subscribe to the saying that "the more we save, the freer we become." When we spend $100, we are spending $107 a year from now, and making it harder for us to exit the "rat race."

### Essentialism ###
I have recently read (listened to) a book by Greg Mckeown called Essentialism. His philosophy of "less but better" resonated with me in my quest to get my finances under control, and to focus on the things that matter. I think we can all learn from Greg, as we all make frivolous purchases that do not advance us as individuals or serve any purpose other than to feed our addiction to novelty and the rush and excitement of buying new things. We need to make sure that our purchases add value to our lives.

I am not a financial expert, so please take my opinion as just that, an opinion. I am a fan of index funds and the diversification they bring, as well as the ability to set my investments on "auto-pilot," but some people like investing in real estate, some people invest in art. Consider this blog post like you would a Wikipedia article when you're doing research. Use the information in this post as a starting point to learn about index funds, investing, personal finance, and saving money so that you can make the decisions that make the most sense for you.
