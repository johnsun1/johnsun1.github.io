My next phone will be a dumb phone. 

I have decided to take this seemingly extreme approach to my technology because I am tired of constantly spending $1,000 (or more) to upgrade to the latest and greatest iPhone or Android phone device. I would rather have a $50 phone that does what I need it to do, without any frills. The leftover money will be saved or invested. The $800 or $900 that I save can be spent on things that enrich my life, rather than on a shiny flagship disposable device.

### Updates ###
Our phones will not get OS and security updates indefinitely. Phone makers want you to purchase a new phone every 1-2 years, so they will stop sending you major OS and security updates past a certain point. Even if that were not an issue, app makers will eventually stop creating versions of their software for old versions of your phone's OS. If I am a developer, I am not going to pay people to support an old OS that 10% of my user base still uses. I am going to focus my efforts on the group of customers that bring in the most money; which (usually) happens to be those who are on the latest and greatest OS. The result of all these issues is that your phone will slowly become less useful, and more of a security risk as more exploits and vulnerabilities are discovered for your software and hardware. Rather than being forced to purchase a new device every 2 years, if I am using a dumb phone, updates are irrelevant. There's "nothing to hack" as these devices are so simple.

### Got new? ###
You know when you buy a shiny new phone, or computer or laptop, and you feel great. From the experience of unboxing this marvel of modern technology to powering it on for the first time, to having your colleagues and friends acknowledge that "oh, you got a new laptop! Neat." However, that rush of excitement gradually goes away, and before you know it, you're back where you started. This tendency to chase things that we don't have will make us forever miserable, and unsatisfied regardless of how much we have. Our goal should be to be content with what we have, while still looking to improve ourselves every day. Simply put, most of us have enough (material) things in our lives.

At the end of the day, while I know that a "dumb phone" will not last forever, I am perfectly content with buying a $50 phone every 4-6 years. There's never a situation where I just **have** to check email, while I am out of the house, or compose some long-form content on my phone while running errands. Everything that I need a phone for, the dumbphone can provide. For everything else, I can either bring my laptop out with me, or I can use my desktop-replacement laptop when I get home. And while I won't be staying on this crazy upgrade treadmill, I will still follow the latest developments in the tech space, as that is something that brings me joy and enriches my life. My expectation is that this new approach to managing my tech upgrades will enrich my financial life, and leave more space (and money) for the things that matter. 

All of this is a roundabout way of saying, my next phone will be a dumb phone.
