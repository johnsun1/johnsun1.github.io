For most of my adult life, I have used laptops for work, education, and entertainment. As someone who proclaims themselves to be a "tech geek", this may seem odd. What kind of self-respecting nerd wouldn't just, build a desktop PC? (Stocked with the latest RTX Nvidia graphics cards, and an octa-core CPU with 128GB of ram.) This guy, of course.

The truth is, I like laptops more than desktop computers. They are portable, they have built-in batteries and built-in wireless communications. (Bluetooth and wifi.) These qualities make it easy for me to reconfigure my workspace for whatever task is at hand. Since these computers have built-in Bluetooth and wifi, I can use my wireless earbuds, and work away from my router. It's that freedom of movement that makes laptops attractive to me. Additionally, because these devices have their own battery, if there is a power outage, I have the opportunity to save my work; without having to purchase a UPS for the same privilege.

On the other side of the fence, desktop computers potentially offer the best performance that money can buy. They are upgradable, very powerful (with the correct components), and they look cool with enough RGB to outshine the Sun. There's the pride of ownership if you build your computer. However, even these perks come with their downsides. Desktop machines are upgradable, but if the newest CPU requires a different socket, then you need to buy a new motherboard. Then, there's the work required to take out the old board and replace it with the new. (With all the associated e-waste that comes from the process.) This also applies if you're replacing your GPU or some other component in your rig. If this is your first time putting together a desktop computer, you are likely to ESD (electrostatic discharge) one of your components, or accidentally bend a pin on your CPU, or crack a RAM module, or one of your parts might be DOA (dead on arrival). For most people, I don't think the risk and inconvenience is worth the reward.

To be fair, laptops are not perfect either. Their form factor requires the designer to make concessions when it comes to thermal design. They often have to thermal throttle themselves (CPU and GPU) to prevent any permanent damage. If a desktop computer is fully upgradable, a laptop is usually very limited. In most cases, you're limited to upgrading the hard drive to an SSD and maybe adding some more RAM. (Doing so requires that you open your laptop, possibly voiding your warranty.)

It comes down to what you value in computers. Do you want great performance and mobility? Or, do you want the bleeding edge in technology, and to play Fortnite at 300 FPS, on a 300 HZ screen, with full graphical details, and ray tracing enabled? If the former is true, go for a laptop. Otherwise, go for a desktop. As for me, I like laptops more.
