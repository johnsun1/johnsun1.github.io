I have taken a cold shower every morning for the past month. While there are disputed health benefits to taking cold showers, I didn't do it for any of those reasons. Taking the cold shower and enduring that temporary discomfort is worth it because the other side of that task is so much better. Here are some other things I've learned from this experience.

### Cupa Joe in the morning ###
Most of us drink coffee or tea in the morning to wake us up and get us ready for the day. A cold shower will wake you right up. And then you can drink your daily cup of coffee afterward.

### Save water, electricity, gas ###
In the past, I have been someone who took 20 minute, even 30 minute showers because I enjoy the water. Now, with cold showers, my time has more than halved for obvious reasons. With this change, I enjoy slightly lower energy and water bills monthly.

### Fear is the enemy ###
I am not always enthusiastic about taking a cold plunge every morning. Sometimes, I need to mentally work myself up to the challenge. However, after I actually take the cold shower, I find that my fears and reservations were unfounded. It's just some cold water. I think that we need to get ourselves in this habit of knowing that most of our fears are overemphasized and that the reality of the challenges that we face, is that they are surmountable. All we have to do is try.

These are some of the lessons that I took away from my cool (haha) experience. While I did not have any issues doing this experiment, I advise you to consult with your doctor before embarking on anything like this. While I do not have any health conditions, everyone is different, and what is right for one person, might not work for another. Thank you for reading, and I'll see you next week.
