It's the end of the month, and you owe $500 on your credit card. You check your credit card statement and see that you have a laundry list of subscriptions (some of which you do not even use). Subscription creep is a real thing that many of us deal with nowadays. Even Adobe is switching to a subscription model for its creative software. While all of this bequeaths us to be mindful of our subscriptions, there are still some gems out there. Here are my subscriptions, and why I find them valuable.

### YouTube Premium ###
I watch a lot of YouTube. For education, inspiration, or just plain entertainment. I have always wanted to contribute to my favorite creators, but the idea of having multiple subscriptions to multiple creators didn't appeal to me. So I took the next best option, YouTube Premium, which pays creators based on your watch time. My Premium plan allows me to add up to 4 family members and share those benefits. Collectively, we have saved hundreds of hours of ad watch time. I get a ton of value out of YouTube Premium, and I can see myself keeping this subscription for the foreseeable future.

### Matt D'Avella ###
I mentioned this briefly in my previous post, but I value Matt's content. So much so that I have decided to subscribe to his Patreon at the highest tier; $12 per month. His content more than justifies the cost between the Patreon-only podcast and his Patreon-only Slack community. I get a lot of value from that $12. If you're interested in self-improvement, cinematic vlogging, or "weird" comedy, then Matt is for you. His sense of humor, drive to improve, and great attitude makes the world a better place.

### Audible Premium Plus ###
Recently, I have gotten big into reading more, and one way that I like to get my information is through audiobooks. It's nice to be able to listen to a novel or non-fiction book while walking. I also enjoy hearing the voice of the author (when it is available). Every month Premium Plus members get a credit that they can use on any audiobook they want, and they also get access to a catalog of audiobooks. I find that this system allows me to get through my "must-read" list while keeping costs relatively low. 

And that is it! I don't have a ton of subscriptions. I try my best to keep my subscriptions to 2 memberships at any time unless there is something that I feel adds a significant amount of value to my life above the cost to obtain it. Sometimes it's easy to underestimate how much something costs. If there is something that I want to subscribe to, I always look at the cost in yearly terms rather than monthly. $12/month is $144/year. The question isn't, "is it worth $12 to subscribe to Matt D'Avella?" The real question is, "is it worth $144 to subscribe to Matt D'Avella?" FYI, the answer is yes!
