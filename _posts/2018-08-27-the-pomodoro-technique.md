### What is it? ###
Francesco Cirillo invented the Pomodoro Technique in the late 1980s. It is a simple productivity strategy that revolves around working in 50-minute sprints, followed by 10-minute breaks.

I had previously experimented with this technique and found that it significantly boosted my productivity. It was easier for me to focus because I had a 10-minute break to look forward to, which kept me from burning out. At one point, I got tired of always resetting a timer and stopped using the technique. As a result, my productivity dropped due to random Facebook and Reddit checking throughout the day. I am considering going back to the Pomodoro Technique.

There are many apps available, on iOS and Android, for helping people adhere to the core tenants of the technique. Some apps try to "gamify" the process. For example,  Forest (by Seekrtech Co., Ltd) allows users to grow a virtual forest while they complete a 50-minute work session. Players can also grow real trees with their in-game currency, cool! 

Rather than use an elaborate app, I find that using my phone's built-in timer works best. However you decide to approach The Pomodoro Technique, the best way to keep track of time is the method that you will use consistently.
